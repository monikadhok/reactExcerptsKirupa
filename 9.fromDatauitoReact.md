Button click do something : 

return (
  <div style={backgroundStyle}>
    <Counter display={this.state.count}/>
    <button onClick={this.increase} style={buttonStyle}>+</button>
  </div>
);

class CounterParent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
 
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
 
    this.increase = this.increase.bind(this); //bind it in the constructor
  }

//define
  increase(e) {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1
    });
  }


  Synthetic events: wraps your browser's native event 
  
  Don’t refer to traditional DOM event documentation when using SyntheticEvents and their properties. 
  Because the SyntheticEvent wraps your native DOM event, events and their properties might not map one-to-one. 
  Some DOM events don’t even exist in React. To avoid running into any issues, if you want to know the name of 
  a SyntheticEvent or any of its properties, refer to the React Event System document
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 One can't listen to events over react components
 No matter how you slice and dice this, none of it matters. It doesn’t matter how simple or obvious the 
 HTML we’re returning via a component looks. You simply can’t listen for events on them directly. This is 
 because components are wrappers for DOM elements. What does it even mean to listen for an event on a 
 component? When your component gets unwrapped into DOM elements, does the outer HTML element act as the 
 thing you’re listening for the event on? Is it some other element? How do you distinguish between listening 
 for an event and declaring a prop you’re listening for?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fortunately, there’s a workaround: We can treat the event handler as a prop and pass it on to the component. 
Inside the component, we can then assign the event to a DOM element and set the event handler to the value of 
the prop we just passed in. I realize that probably makes no sense, so let’s walk through an example.

render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Counter display={this.state.count} />
        <PlusButton clickHandler={this.increase} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

class PlusButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.props.clickHandler}>
        +
      </button>
    );
  }
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Listening to Regular DOM Events
If you thought the previous section was a doozy, wait until you see what we have here. Not all DOM 
events have SyntheticEvent equivalents. It might seem like you can just add the on prefix and capitalize 
the event you’re listening for when specifying it inline in your JSX:
It doesn’t work that way! For events that React doesn’t officially recognize, you have to follow the 
traditional approach that uses addEventListener with a few extra hoops to jump through.

  componentDidMount() {
    window.addEventListener("someEvent", this.handleMyEvent);
  }
 
  componentWillUnmount() {
    window.removeEventListener("someEvent", this.handleMyEvent);
  }

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The meaning of this inside the event listener. 

  In the React world, the value of this does not refer to the element that fired the event. The value 
  is the very unhelpful (yet correct) undefined. That’s why we need to explicitly specify what this binds 
  to using the bind method, as you’ve seen a few times:

 constructor(props) {
    super(props);
 
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
 
    this.increase = this.increase.bind(this);
  }
