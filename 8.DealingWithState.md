Properties of the components are immutableonce they are set. Sometimes, you do not want that. You 
would want to change the aspect of the component as a result of some interaction. 
Need a way to store data that can be changed : state

Example, track a counter
setInterval that calls some code every 1 second. We are relying on following APIs.
1. ComponentDidMount : just after component is rendered
2. setState : allows you to update the values of state

//setting the state
class LightningCounter extends React.Component {
    //This runs way before the component is rendered.
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
 
    this.state = {
      strikes: 0
    };
  }
 
  timerTick() {
    this.setState({
      strikes: this.state.strikes + 100
    });
  }
 
  componentDidMount() {
    setInterval(this.timerTick, 1000);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <h1>{this.state.strikes}</h1>
    );
  }
}

Note:
 We are getting the existing state by calling this.state.strikes. For performance related reasons, 
 React might decide to batch updates in rapid succession. This could lead to original value stored 
 by this.state to be out of sync with reality. To help with this, setState gives access to prevState.


this.setState((prevState) => {
   return {
     strikes: prevState.strikes + 100
   };
 });

ould you use this approach to update your state? There are good arguments on both sides. One side 
argues for correctness, despite this.state working out fine for most real-world cases. The other side 
argues for keeping the code simple and not introducing additional complexity. There’s no right or wrong 
answer here, so use whatever approach you prefer. I’m calling this out only for completeness because 
you could run into the prevState approach in any React code you encounter in the wild.

//Explicitly bind our timeTick function to the component
//Will return typeError otherwise

constructor(props) {
    super(props);
 
    this.state = {
        strikes: 0
    };
 
    this.timerTick = this.timerTick.bind(this);
}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
" Whenever you call setState and update something in the state object, your component’s render method gets automatically 
called" This kicks off a cascade of render calls for any component whose output is also affected. The end result 
of all this is that what you see on your screen in the latest representation of your app’s UI state. Keeping your
data and UI in sync is one of the hardest problems with UI development, so it’s nice that React takes care of this 
for us. It makes all this pain of learning to use React totally worth it…almost!
