One of the biggest things we’ve glossed over is trying to figure out what happens with our 
JSX after we’ve written it. How does it end up as the HTML that you see in the browser? Take a look 
at the following example, where we define a component called Card:

class Card extends React.Component {
  render() {
    var cardStyle = {
      height: 200,
      width: 150,
      padding: 0,
      backgroundColor: "#FFF",
      boxShadow: "0px 0px 5px #666"
    };
 
    return (
      <div style={cardStyle}>
        <Square color={this.props.color} />
        <Label color={this.props.color} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

Keep in mind that browsers have no idea what to do with JSX. They probably think you’re crazy 
if you even try to describe JSX to them. That’s why we’ve been relying on things like Babel to turn that 
JSX into something the browsers understand: JavaScript.

JSX is treated like JavaScript. As you’ve seen a few times already, this means that you aren’t limited 
to dealing with static content like the following:

class Stuff extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Boring static content!</h1>
    );
  }
};

The values you return can be dynamically generated. All you have to do is wrap your expression in curly 
braces: These curly braces allow your app to first evaluate the expression and then return the result of 
the evaluation. 

class Stuff extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Boring {Math.random() * 100} content!</h1>
    );
  }
}

Returning multiple elements:

In a lot of our examples, we’ve returned one top-level element (often a div) that then had many other 
elements under it. You aren’t technically limited to following that pattern: You can actually return 
multiple elements. And you can do that in two ways.

class Stuff extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      [
        <p>I am</p>,
        <p>returning a list</p>,
        <p>of things!</p>
      ]
    );
  }
}

Here we are returning three p tags. They don’t have a single common parent. Now, when you return multiple 
items, you might or might not have to deal with one detail, depending on the version of React you are targeting. 
You need to specify a key attribute and a unique value for each item:

class Stuff extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      [
        <p key="1">I am</p>,
        <p key="2">returning a list</p>,
        <p key="3">of things!</p>
      ]
    );
  }
}

This helps React better understand which element it is dealing with and whether to make any changes to it. 
How do you know whether you need to add the key attribute? React tells you. You’ll see a message similar to the 
following printed to your Dev Tools Console: Warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique 
“key” prop.

You also have another (and, arguably, better) way to return multiple elements. This involves something 
known as fragments. The way you use it looks as follows:

class Stuff extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <p>I am</p>
        <p>returning a list</p>
        <p>of things!</p>
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}

1) This component doesn’t actually generate a DOM element. It is just something you specify in JSX that has 
no tangible existence when transpiled into the HTML your browser sees.

2) You aren’t treating what you are returning as items in an array, so you don’t need commas or anything 
separating each item.

3) There’s no need to specify a unique key attribute and value; this is all taken care of under the covers 
for you.

Before we leave this section, know that you can use a more condensed syntax instead of fully specifying 
React.Fragment... like an animal. You can use just empty <> and </> tags:

class Stuff extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <p>I am</p>
        <p>returning a list</p>
        <p>of things!</p>
      </>
    );
  }
}


You can not specify CSS inline:
<div style="font-family:Arial;font-size:24px">
  <p>Blah!</p>
</div>
In JSX, the style attribute can’t contain CSS inside it. Instead, it needs to refer to an object that contains 
styling information:

class Letter extends React.Component {
  render() {
    var letterStyle = {
      padding: 10,
      margin: 10,
      backgroundColor: this.props.bgcolor,
      color: "#333",
      display: "inline-block",
      fontFamily: "monospace",
      fontSize: "32",
      textAlign: "center"
    };
 
    return (
      <div style={letterStyle}>
        {this.props.children}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

Notice that we have an object called letterStyle that that contains all the CSS properties (in camel-case 
JavaScript form) and their values. That object is what we then specify to the style attribute.


Comments:
Just as it’s a good idea to comment your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it’s a good idea to provide comments 
inside your JSX. Specifying comments in JSX is similar to how you comment in JavaScript, with one exception. 
If you’re specifying a comment as a child of a tag, you need to enclose your comment within the { and } 
angle brackets to ensure that it is parsed as an expression:

ReactDOM.render(
  <div className="slideIn">
    <p className="emphasis">Gabagool!</p>
    {/* I am a child comment */}
    <Label/>
  </div>,
  document.querySelector("#container")
);

HTML tag is lowercase : 

ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <section>
      <p>Something goes here!</p>
    </section>
  </div>,
  document.querySelector("#container")
);
