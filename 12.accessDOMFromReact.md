Our JSX is simply a description of what the DOM should look like. It doesn’t represent actual HTML, despite 
looking a whole lot like it. To provide a bridge between JSX and the final HTML elements in the DOM, React 
provides us with something funnily named as refs (short for references).


return (
    <div className="colorArea">
      <div style={squareStyle} className="colorSquare"></div>
 
      <form onSubmit={this.setNewColor}>
        <input onChange={this.colorValue}
               ref={}
               placeholder="Enter a color value"></input>
        <button type="submit">go</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

Because we’re interested in the input element, our ref attribute is attached to it. Right now, our ref attribute 
is empty. What you typically set as the ref attribute’s value is a JavaScript callback function. This function 
gets called automatically when the component housing this render method gets mounted. If we set our ref 
attribute’s value to a simple JavaScript function that stores a reference to the referenced DOM element, 
it would look something like the following highlighted lines:


render() {
  var squareStyle = {
    backgroundColor: this.state.bgColor
  };
 
  var self = this; //And this!
 
  return (
    <div className="colorArea">
      <div style={squareStyle} className="colorSquare"></div>
 
      <form onSubmit={this.setNewColor}>
        <input onChange={this.colorValue}
               ref={
                 function(el) {
                   self._input = el;
                 }
               }
               placeholder="Enter a color value"></input>
        <button type="submit">go</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}


function(el) {
 self._input = el;
}
This anonymous function gets called when our component mounts, and a reference to the final HTML DOM element 
is passed in as an argument. We capture this argument using the el identifier, but you can use any name for 
this argument that you want. The body of this callback function simply sets a custom property called _input to 
the value of our DOM element. To ensure that we create this property on our component, we use the self 
variable to create a closure—the this in question refers to our component instead of the callback function itself. 
Phew!


Our goal is to clear the contents of our input element and give focus to it once the form gets submitted. The 
code for doing that will live in our setNewColor method, so add the following highlighted lines:

setNewColor(e) {
  this.setState({
    bgColor: this.state.color
  });
 
  this._input.focus(); //set the focus to inpt
  this._input.value = ""; //clears the color we entered.
 
  e.preventDefault();
}
